1.	No command queue; can only hold a single command:

	If the program is in a cooling or heating cycle, the
	user is able to enter in a command mid process which will
	then be processed next after the current command is processed.
	
	However, there is not a queue that holds multiple commands.
	So, if a user then enters a second command before the current
	temperature reaches the chosen temperature, it will clear the
	command queued before it.
